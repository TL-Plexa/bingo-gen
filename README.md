Scripts and data for generating bingo objectives for TLA Rando

The main files are bingo_generator.py and Bingo Eval.csv. Run bingo_generator from the command line and it will generate objectives based on the logic dictated by Bingo Eval in addition to some soft limits on psynergy frequency.

diagnostic.ipynb is a jupyter lab notebook file that is probably extremely borked that runs some basic diagnostics on objective frequency. This probably needs an overhaul, but it's included for completeness. Some of these sameple outputs are in the two frequency .csv files - although I don't trust that these are necessarily true!
